## NeoVim for Command Line System
- To install:
```
git clone https://github.com/weremax/nvim-basecamp.git ~/.config/nvim
```

### Reason
This is an extremely light weight NeoVim configuration as an editor for my ThinkPad X131e with a minimal Arch Linux install that does not have a GUI (command-line-only system).

### Packages
- packer.nvim - use :PackerSync
- treesitter
- lualine
- telescope
- mason
- lsp

Just a very basic functional NeoVim editor style setup for quickly being able to use the system effectively from the command line.
